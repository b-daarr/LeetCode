[1- Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.


Example 1:

> Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].


Example 2:

> Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]


Example 3:

> Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
